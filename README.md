=========================================
# SOLID principle
# Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
# Open-Close Principle(OCP): open for extention and close for modification
# Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of the program.
# Interface Segregation Principle(ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
# Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP):
  High level modules should not depend on low-level modules.Both should depend on abstration.
  Abstraction should not depend upon details.Details should depend upon abstractions.

  Inversion of Control(IoC): actual process of creating abstractions and getting them to replace dependencies.

  Dependency Injection: Use of software framework to ensure that a component's dependencies are satisfied.
